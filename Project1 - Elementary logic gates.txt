Project 1: Boolean Logic

Background:

A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as their bit-wise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). This project engages you in the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates.

Objective:

Build all the logic gates described below, yielding a basic chip-set. The only building blocks that you can use in this project are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you will gradually build on top of them. For each logic gate (except primitive Nand gate) you need to build the Vhdl file and the Test script.
